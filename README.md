Welcome to my epic repository of solutions to CCExtractor's Tasks!

## Armstrong

Take a look at main.rs in /armstrong/src for my Armstrong number validator!

Learning Rust proved to be very difficult at first, because I use python and javascript a lot more than C / C++.

## Leap Year

Take a look at main.rs in /leapyear/src for my Leap Year validator!

## GPS App

Take a look at /cc_gps for my Flutter GPS app!

This proved to take a surprising amount of time, requiring _a LOT_ of debugging. A surprising amount for such a simple task...

However, I learned a lot about good design, especially SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). It felt like overkill for this task and was the cause of a lot of struggle because I implemented it incorrectly at first.
