Welcome to my epic repository of solutions to CCExtractor's Tasks!

## Armstrong

Take a look at main.rs in /armstrong/src for my Armstrong number validator!

Learning Rust proved to be very difficult at first, because I use python and javascript a lot more than C / C++.

## Leap Year

Take a look at main.rs in /leapyear/src for my Leap Year validator!

## GPS App

Take a look at /cc_gps for my Flutter GPS app!

This proved to take a surprising amount of time, requiring _a LOT_ of debugging. A surprising amount for such a simple task...

However, I learned a lot about good design, especially SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). It felt like overkill for this task and was the cause of a lot of struggle because I implemented it incorrectly at first.

## Maze App

This app generates a random maze on each button press!

Check it out in /cc_maze

## Other Work For CCExtractor

The other work I've done for CCExtractor lives here:

- [Unit Converter](https://github.com/dhrumilp15/UnitConverter) is a graph-based command line unit converter!
- [Qui Qui (Who - Who)](https://github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui) is a who-is-who app developed completely in flutter!
